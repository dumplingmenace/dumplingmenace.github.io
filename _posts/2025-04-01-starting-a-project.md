I'm trying to keep track of my lil journey to make a map using javascript and R. 
I was inspired by Nadieh Bremer of [Visual Cinnamon](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/2023/04/personal-map-norway-with-javascript/) and thought it would be good practice for my rusty mapping skills! I have no d3 or javascript skills though so I'm currently stuck at the part where I have a map in r and don't know what to do next. I will figure it out next, though it's going to be slow since I'm also moving this month.

It does feel a little silly to talk about a project I'm not done yet but I don't have a paper notebook and am moving so don't want to buy one yet! I will keep thinking and practicing though. Also saw this blog on bluesky ["Observable for R Users"](https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/observable-r-users/) that I'm going to work through and see if it helps!
