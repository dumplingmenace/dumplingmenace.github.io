Okay 2025 got away from me. Moved back to philly unexpectedly, George the Chihuahua,
my perfect small son was diagnosed with kidney disease and told he had weeks to live and then he lived for several months. 
He made it to Philly and his patio and I am grateful but I miss him. But I'm going to try this again but better this time!

One thing that is important is that Minnesota is currently under attack and I hate it!
For those of us not in Minnesota at the moment, there are some suggestions for helping <a href="https://www.standwithminnesota.com">here</a>. 

Anyway if I do NOT blog it will simply be another failed attempt at a blog in a long tradition of failed blog attempts.
